-- Create a model with the name 'emoji_sentiment_bot'
-- This model will accept a text string, perform sentiment analysis,
-- This time we will use text_generation, the responses will not be limited to predefined values.
-- Response will, however, be entirely in emoji form.
-- The analysis is performed based on the prompt we provide in conjunction with the text input.
-- The connection 'openai-chat-completions-connection' was a pre-established Flink connection.
-- That connection was created via the Confluent CLI to provide an OpenAI API key to Flink.

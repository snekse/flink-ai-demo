- a Stream processing [Workspace](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/get-started/quick-start-cloud-console.html#step-1-create-a-workspace) on Confluent Cloud

# üìù Instructions

For each `.sql` file in this `EX-01-simple-example` folder, create a "cell", 
paste the contents from the file to your workspace cell, 
then [Run the SQL](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/get-started/quick-start-cloud-console.html#step-2-run-sql-statements).
